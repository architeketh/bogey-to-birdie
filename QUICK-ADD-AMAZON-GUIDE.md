## 🔧 Advanced Tips:

### **URL Formats That Work:**

The tool is smart and works with ANY Amazon URL format:

✅ **Standard:** `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RNGWQJ`
✅ **With product name:** `https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Watch/dp/B084RNGWQJ`
✅ **GP format:** `https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084RNGWQJ`
✅ **With parameters:** `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RNGWQJ?ref=xyz`
✅ **Shortened:** `https://amzn.to/3xyz`
✅ **Mobile:** `https://m.amazon.com/dp/B084RNGWQJ`
✅ **International:** `https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B084RNGWQJ`

**It extracts the ASIN (product ID) automatically!**

---

### **What's an ASIN?**

ASIN = Amazon Standard Identification Number

- **It's the unique 10-character product code**
- Format: B084RNGWQJ (starts with B followed by 9 alphanumeric chars)
- Every Amazon product has one
- **Example:** In `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RNGWQJ`, the ASIN is `B084RNGWQJ`

The tool finds this automatically and creates a clean affiliate link!

---

### **Your Affiliate Tag:**

Your tag: **bogeytobird0e-20**

**Every product link automatically gets:**
```
?tag=bogeytobird0e-20
```

**This means you earn commission when someone:**
1. Clicks your link
2. Buys the product (or anything else) within 24 hours
3. Amazon credits your account! 💰

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### **"Could not find a valid Amazon product ID"**

**This means:**
- The URL isn't a product page
- It's a search page, category page, or something else

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're on an actual product page
- The URL should have `/dp/` or `/gp/product/` in it
- Look for the 10-character ASIN code

### **"Please enter an Amazon product URL"**

**This means:**
- The input field is empty

**Solution:**
- Make sure you pasted the URL
- Try copying the URL again

### **Affiliate tag not showing up**

**This shouldn't happen, but if it does:**
- The tag is: `bogeytobird0e-20`
- It should appear as: `?tag=bogeytobird0e-20` at the end
- Check the "Affiliate Link" display in the modal
